# jquery-reveal

npm-installable fork of [Reveal](https://github.com/zurb/reveal), a jquery-plugin modal

## Instructions

Add a "data-reveal-id" attribute to the element that will dispatch the modal (typically an anchor or button).

When clicked the plugin matches the value of the "data-reveal-id" attribute (eg. "myModal") with an HTML element with that ID.

Basically, put the "data-reveal-id" attribute on an object and make it's value the ID of your modal.
